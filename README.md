#### I created this project when I was working as a case resolution expert for FlightHub.
#### I noticed that many of my colleagues were having a very difficult time calculating partially-used air ticket refund amounts and the travel app Amadeus was not making it any easier, which would result in errors during calculation and would take a substantial amount of the agent's time trying to get the refundable amount while not making mistakes. I noticed that they often used Microsoft's built-in Notepad app to paste multiple taxes, used coupon fares, unused coupon fares, surcharges and sometimes converting all those numbers into different currencies.
#### The app makes it significantly easier, quicker and more reliable to calculate the refundable amount even compared to calculations done by the industry's expert travel agents, since it automates the calculation process.
#### The Youtube video link is also added in the app's footer with the icon "?" for ease of understanding.
