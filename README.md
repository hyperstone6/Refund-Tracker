#### The video tutorial on how to use the app:

#### I created this project when I was working as a case resolution expert for FlightHub. The app has since been tested by my senior colleagues in the company and has become a part of their routine during partially-used airline ticket refund calculation. 
#### I noticed that many of my colleagues were having a very difficult time calculating partially-used air ticket refund amounts and the travel app Amadeus was not making it any easier, which would result in errors during calculation and would take a substantial amount of the agent's time trying to get the refundable amount while trying to not make mistakes during calculation. 
#### I noticed that they often used Microsoft's built-in Notepad app to paste multiple taxes, used coupon fares, unused coupon fares, surcharges, subtracting one from the other, and sometimes converting all those numbers into different currencies.
#### The app makes it significantly easier, quicker and more reliable to calculate the refundable amount even compared to calculations done by the industry's expert travel agents, since it automates the calculation process.
#### The Youtube tutorial video link I made is also added in the app's footer with the icon "?" for ease of reference.
#### For obvious reasons, the app is not responsive to different viewports since the travel agencies' Amadeus app, referred in the industry as a GDS (Global Distribution System), is based only on the desktop environment.
#### To summarize briefly, Amadeus app is used globally by as much as 50% of global travel agencies to issue and modify airline tickets.
